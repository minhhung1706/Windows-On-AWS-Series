### EC2 Configuration 
---

We are now going to configure EC2 on both **AWS Site** and **Local Site**

---

**I. AWS Site**  
If you were not ready, then back to the basic guide before doing this lab. I assumed you have already leveled up your skills:  

In this site, what we need to do are:  
- Edit Computer Name
- Edit the IP Address
- Edit hosts file
- Install the neccessary Administrator Tools (basic guide)
- Test the communication between EC2 Bastion and EC2 AD-Manager

**II. Local Site**  
We need to upgrade the EC2 in the private network to Domain Controller   

1. Open Server Mamanger to perform the tasks
