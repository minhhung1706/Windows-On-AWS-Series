# Windows On AWS Series
---
## Forewords

In this Windows On AWS Series, we will start to explore AWS Service in which can help us to plan, to deliver and to deploy Windows and its services on AWS. We are not going to jump; however, we are going to do step by step from the very basic like how we eat daily to the very advances that i do not even know what i am writing about.

There are some concept i will repeat, incase it is neccessary; however, there are some that i will not cover/repeat because i understand that you are clever more than enough to catch up the technology. 

Moreover, if you have something unclear, you can find this starter section and go throught again and/or use Bing / Google. 

Trust me, to work in technology field, searching; in general, is an advanced skill that need to be polished. Search and found what you need, consider whether to implement or not and so on

Additionally, searching when/while working with the cloud (tech-cloud, not that cloud) is very crucial because there are so manything that even AWS document will not cover. It is case-by-case and solve-by-case. There are so many solution for a specific issue.

## 1. What is AWS
AWS is stand for Amazon Web Service. Priority, AWS was not used public, it is rather than an in-house datacenter of Amazon to help to serve for the internal traffic and workload. 

At the end of the day (i did not know which day, but yeah), Amazon thought about to public AWS for world-wide usage and we have AWS nowawday. 

Visit the link if you found some interested in the history of AWS. Link: [History of AWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Amazon_Web_Services)


## 2. Basic Concept
Please understand that, i am not going to go throught more than 2000 (two thousands) AWS Services. Instead, i will only go throught what we are going to use in the Windows On AWS Lab Series
